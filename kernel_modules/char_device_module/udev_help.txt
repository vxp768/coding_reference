 ./module/ebbchar

We then need to identify the KERNEL and SUBSYSTEM values about which to write the rule. You can use the udevadm command to perform this task:
 molloyd@beaglebone:~/exploringBB/extras/kernel/ebbchar$ udevadm info -a -p /sys/class/ebb/ebbchar
 Udevadm info starts with the device specified by the devpath and then walks up the chain of parent
 devices. It prints for every device found, all possible attributes in the udev rules key format. A
 rule to match, can be composed by the attributes of the device and the attributes from one single
 parent device.
           looking at device '/devices/virtual/ebb/ebbchar':
              KERNEL=="ebbchar"
              SUBSYSTEM=="ebb"
              DRIVER==""

The rules are contained in the /etc/udev/rules.d directory. A new rule can be added as a file using these values, where the file begins with a priority number. Using a name such as 99-ebbchar.rules creates a new rule with the lowest priority, so that it does not interfere with other device rules. The rule can be written as in Listing 5 and placed in the /etc/udev/rules.d directory as follows:
 molloyd@beaglebone:/etc/udev/rules.d$ ls
 50-hidraw.rules  50-spi.rules  60-omap-tty.rules  70-persistent-net.rules 99-ebbchar.rules
 molloyd@beaglebone:/etc/udev/rules.d$ more 99-ebbchar.rules
 #Rules file for the ebbchar device driver
 KERNEL=="ebbchar", SUBSYSTEM=="ebb", MODE="0666"
