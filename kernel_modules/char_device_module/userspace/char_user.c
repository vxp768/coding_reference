/*
The %[^\n]%*c uses the scanset specifiers, which are represented by %[] to use the ^ character to stop reading after the first occurrence of the \n character. 
In addition, the %*c ignores the trailing character, ensuring that the subsequent getchar() function works as required. i
Essentially, the scanf() code just reads in a sentence. If scanf() was used with a 
regular %s call then the string would terminated at the first occurrence of the space character.
